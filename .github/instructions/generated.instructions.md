# Generated Code Style and Project Instructions

## General Project Guidelines

- **Simplicity:** Keep solutions simple and straightforward. User highly values code simplification and reducing complexity.
- **Performance Optimization:** Prioritize bundle size reduction and performance. User is concerned about over-engineering and excessive dependencies.
- **Comments:** Remove unnecessary comments. Do not add new comments unless explicitly clarifying complex logic.
- **File Formatting:** Always include an empty line at the end of each file.
- **Decoupling:** Emphasize decoupled components and modules.
- **Reusability:** Design structures and components to be reusable. Move reusable structure to layouts.
- **Minimal Changes:** Keep changes to existing code as minimal as possible. Only update existing logic or definitions when necessary.
- **Clarity:** If unsure about any requirement, always ask for clarification.
- **Development Server:** Start the development server as the first step and keep it running. Use its output to identify and fix errors. Open a new terminal for additional commands if needed.
- **Technologies:** The project uses Astro JS, Lit, and Fluent UI.
- **Bundle Optimization:** User prefers lightweight solutions over heavy frameworks. Consider native alternatives to large dependencies.
- **Project Goal:** Create a portfolio site for a software developer (GitHub: https://github.com/anoblet/).
- **Content Requirements:**
  - Include a services page.
  - Include a projects page featuring CXL (https://cxl.com/), Graduation Source (https://graduationsource.com/), and Avanti Systems USA (https://avantisystemsusa.com). Analyze these websites to create appropriate descriptions from a software developer's perspective.

## Component and Layout Design

- **Component Granularity:** Create as many new components as necessary.
- **Component Simplicity:** Components should be simple and composable.
- **Layouts:**
  - Astro is used for layouts and pages.
  - Layouts should centralize shared structures (e.g., headers, footers) and use slots for content.
- **Web Components:** Use LitElement (Web Components) for interactive UI elements.
- **Astro Components:** Use Astro components for static content and layout structure.
- **Minimalism:** Components should be minimal, with logic and structure separated for reusability.
- **Base Classes/Utilities:** Utilize shared base classes and utilities for common functionality and styles.
- **Organization:** Maintain a clear project structure, separating assets, components, layouts, and pages.
- **Maintainability:** Design the codebase for maintainability and extensibility, focusing on composability and DRY principles.

## Styling (CSS)

- **CSS Variables:** Use CSS variables extensively, especially for colors, spacing, and typography to support a global color scheme and potential theming.
- **Global Color Scheme:** Adhere strictly to the global color scheme defined in `src/styles/global.ts` and `src/styles/colors.css`.
- **Aesthetic:** Use a dark background (`#333`) with accent colors (`#19f9d8`, `#45a9f9`). The overall aesthetic should be modern and minimal.
- **Efficiency:** Write CSS rules to be as efficient as possible.
- **Scoping:** Styles must be scoped to their respective components.
- **Direct Targeting:** It's permissible to target element`s directly (e.g., `h1`) without requiring a parent class, where appropriate.
- **Atomic CSS:** Strive for atomic CSS principles to ensure brand continuity and reusability of styles.
- **Utility Classes:** Use utility CSS classes from the global stylesheet when available; avoid page-specific CSS classes.
- **Responsive Design:** Implement responsive design using flexbox, grid, and media queries.
- **Interactive States:** Ensure interactive elements have clear hover and focus states.

## TypeScript/JavaScript

- **Decorators:** When using decorators, include the `accessor` keyword (as per TypeScript 4.9+ auto-accessors).

## HTML

- **Semantic HTML:** Prioritize the use of semantic HTML for clarity and accessibility.
- **Accessibility (A11y):** Consider accessibility by using semantic HTML and ARIA roles where appropriate.

## Specific Component Instructions

- **Navigation Component:**
  - Create a new navigation component to be placed inside the header.
  - Implement a hamburger menu icon for mobile views.
  - Use tabs for desktop views.
  - Include GitHub, LinkedIn, and Email icons on the right-hand side.

## Chat and Instruction Management

- **Chat Logging:** Save every chat interaction in `chats/` directory using the prescribed format.
- **Chat Log Format:**

  ```markdown
  # Chat Interaction - [timestamp]
